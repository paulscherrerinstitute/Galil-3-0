The SL6 target must be built natively, cross-building
from a RHEL7 machine using devtoolset-7 does not work
because the devtoolset run-time libraries are not
backwards compatible. I.e., a shared-library object
built on RHEL7 for SL6 references symbols that are
present in the RHEL7 run-time libraries but not in
SL6's.

Therefore, the GalilSup module must be built (and installed)
natively from SL6 and/or RHEL7 machines.

T.S., 5/2020.
